Mmm. I look good. I mean, really good. Hey, everyone! Come and see how good I look!
How are you? You look awfully nice tonight. Hmm? Maybe don't wear a bra next time. No, I was talking to you. No, not her. I don't know her name.  What is it? Lanolin. La - Lanolin? Like - like sheep's wool?
Mm, I love scotch. I love Scotch. Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch. Here it goes down. Down into my belly. Mm-mm-mm.
The arsonist has oddly shaped feet.
Oh, come on. Audrey. I look like hell. I got bags under my eyes. What's that? Well, if you were a man, I would punch you. I'd punch you right in the mouth. That's bush. Bush league.
[clears throat] The Human Torch was denied a bank loan.
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy, and this is what's happening in your world tonight. A La Jolla man clings to life at a university hospital after being viciously attacked by a pack of wild dogs in an abandoned pool.
For all of us here at News Center Four, I'm Ron Burgundy. You stay classy, San Diego.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I please have your attention? I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story. I need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen. Cannonball!
[upon seeing Veronica Corningstone for the first time] By the beard of Zeus!
[to Baxter] Yoo-hoo! [clears throat] Baxter! Papa's home. There he is.  There's my little man. You're okay? O - Of course, I met a lady tonight.  This one was different. I have to be honest. Quite different. What? I'm lonely? I'm not lonely! I - I'm beloved by everyone in San Diego. Wow.  You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter. You're so wise. [laughs] You're like a miniature Buddha covered in hair. Come again? You know I don't speak Spanish. In English, please. Huh? You pooped in the refrigerator? And you ate the whole . . . wheel of cheese? How'd you do that? That's actually - I'm not even mad. That's amazing. [laughs again] I forgive you. What do you say we get you in your PJs and we hit the hay? Huh? Bedtime. Okay, come on. Let's go. Come on.
[to Brian Fantana] We've been going to the same party every night for 12 years now...and in no way is that depressing.
I know that one day, Veronica and I are gonna get married on top of a mountain. And there's going to be flutes playing and trombones and flowers and garlands of fresh herbs. And we will dance 'til the sun rises. And then our children will form a family band. And we will tour the countryside, and you won't be invited!
It's so damn hot . . . milk was a bad choice!
[from the outtakes] Huh! Oh! Great Odin's raven!
[from the outtakes] Huh! Oh! By the hammer of Thor!
[from the outtakes] Huh! Saint Damien's beard!
[from the outtakes] Sweet grandmother's spatula!
[from the outtakes] Uncle Jonathan's corncob pipe!
